# Motivation

You are given a research paper in the sub-field of flow visualization.  Your
task is to summarize the research paper in two pages (two sides of A4 paper).
This assignment requires understanding the research paper given to you,
extracting the important ideas and information, putting it into your own words,
and condensing the research paper down to two pages.

**Special Help Video Tutorials**: There are two
special video tutorials that explain more on how
to carry out this assignment. One is called,
"How to Read a Scientific Research Paper: Extracting the Essentials":
<https://youtu.be/M5G1_9Gsnqg>.
The second one is called, "On Close and DistantReading of Research Papers":
<https://youtu.be/Q7ruNLUEMFg>.
I recommend you watch the video tutorials before carrying out this assignment.
The video tutorials explain how to summarize a research paper using only one
page in some of the same categories used here. This assignment allows you to use
two pages. This is easier than boiling it down to one page.

# Tasks

Please note, if you request a paper from me then I will be expecting a summary
submission by the deadline. In other words, you cannot decide after requesting
the paper that you don't want to do this coursework.

This assignment has 3 main tasks:

1. **Before 21 April**: Request a paper from me via email. Make sure the
   subject of the email is "CSCM337/CSCM37 CW3 paper request". I'll be
   processing these requests using a script. So, the subject is incorrect then
   you won't get a paper from me. I also won't be reading the emails so send
   any questions in a separate email, please. Requests after this date (11:59pm
   21 April swansea time) won't be honoured. This is to give you ample time to
   complete reading the paper and write a summary. 
2. Read the paper
3. Write the report :) See below for important information about formatting 
   and content.

# Format of the report

1. The title is the same as the paper your were assigned with the 
   sub-title ": A Two Page Summary" appended.
2. The author is given as your name (with student number).
3. The current date is provided.
4. The font size is 11 or 12 point.

I highly recommend trying LaTeX to write your report. It has excellent support
for including figures, typesetting math or code, and managing references. Plus
the documents are easier to version control than word or Google docs.
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an online LaTeX editor that has a 
number of useful tutorials on LaTeX in general: 
<https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials>. LaTeX can have Even if you decide you never
want to use LaTeX again after this assignment, it's worth trying it out to
explore new tools.

# Content of the report

Your two page summary contains the following
sections with the content indicated and answers
to the corresponding questions.

## Summary of Concept (or Problem Statement)

Your two page summary must contain a conceptual summary of the assigned 
paper. Which category of vector field visualization does this paper
fall into? What are the authors trying to achieve
at a conceptual level? What is the goal of the
work? 

## Contributions

What is (are) the contribution(s) of the paper?
Are they given explicitly or do they have to be
extracted by the reader? In other words, what is
the novelty? What do the authors present that is
new (never been presented prior to the publication
of this paper)?

## Related Work Summary

What is the most important piece of related work
relevant to the given paper? In other words, what
previous research does this build on? The current work may build on more 
than one previous research paper. 

## Summary of Implementation

Your summary contains a brief description of theimplementation. You are not
expected to under-stand all of the implementation detail of any paper but the
basic strategy is conveyed. 

## Summary of Results

The summary contains a brief description of the results. Are the performance 
times given? Are data set sizes provided? What are the characteristics of 
the data set tested?

## Analysis and Discussion

What are the disadvantages of the proposed method? Does it have any flaws or
shortcomings?  Does it have any limitations? This information is more difficult
to extract from the paper as the authors may being trying to hide it.


## References

Your two page summary contains references and
uses citations. It cites the paper you have been
given. 

You are encouraged to use images and/or figures in your summary.

# Submission

You are required to submit your report via blackboard as a single PDF document
before the deadline. No other format is acceptable.
